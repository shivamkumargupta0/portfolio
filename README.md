Lab Title: Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

This lab focuses on designing and developing a fully responsive personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The objective of this project is to showcase personal details, skills, projects, and contact information in a visually structured format while ensuring compatibility across multiple screen sizes. The layout is built using modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and CSS Grid, to achieve dynamic responsiveness and user-friendly navigation.



The portfolio demonstrates clean UI design, accessibility considerations, and responsive design principles by adapting the layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices without using external frameworks.
